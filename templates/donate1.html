        <h1>Support Poor and Needy Children for Education</h1>

            <img src="static/images/needy.jpg" style="width:100%;height:100%">
            <a>This fundraiser seeks to provide books, bags and uniforms to many more children coming from financially challenged families and studying in our Day School, which provides free education to children along with free pickup and drop facility. <br><br>The children are from poor backgrounds, have not been attending any school and are more prone to become street children or child labour. All children are from extreme poor socio-economic backgrounds residing in slums. A majority of children are from families where both parents are daily wages earners. Lack of consistent income is one of the major factors affecting their overall living. Some of the children are also orphans. More than half of the families fall under below poverty line. The purpose of our  School is two folded. While the focus is on educational mainstreaming of these children, the underlying concern is also the protection and safety of children in their neighborhood in the absence of their parents. The life of these children would be much more horrible if in case they are pushed for labour by their parents or if the children run away and start living on streets. So, we are addressing the overall issues of child rights focused upon education, health & safety. We aim to provide quality education using technology wherever necessary & possible thus ensuring children learn in an enabling environment.
            <br><br>We earnestly appeal one and all to come forward & strengthen our efforts with your kind and generous contributions to enable these children seek quality education with dignity and compassion.
